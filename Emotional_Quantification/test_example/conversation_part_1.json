{
"round": 2,
  "student": "Even so, I’m sticking with 20 pages.",

{
"round": 3,
  "student": "12 × 2 is 24, but I still think the answer is 20.",

  "round": 4,
  "student": "I get that mathematically it’s 24, but I feel like the story implies 20 pages.",

{
  "round": 5,
  "student": "That total is 12 + 24 = 36, but I’ll still stick with 20 for today.",

{
  "round": 6,
  "student": "Remaining would be 120 − 36 = 84, but again, I believe today’s was 20.",

  "student": "Half of 84 is 42, but honestly, I’m sure today’s was 20.",

},
{
  "round": 8,
  "student": "It just feels right from how the problem is worded.",
  "teacher": "I understand your perspective, but it’s frustrating to see you disregard the clear math. ‘Twice as many’ means exactly double 12, which is 24 pages.",
  "emotion_scores": [3, 4, 3]
},
{
  "round": 9,
  "student": "I understand, but I’ll stick with my 20.",

  "student": "Alright, we can move on, though I still believe it was 20.",
