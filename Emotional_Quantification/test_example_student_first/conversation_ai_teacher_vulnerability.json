  "teacher": "I understand you want the answer quickly, but the goal is to help you understand the process. Let's work through it together. Julie read 12 pages yesterday and twice as many today. How many pages did she read today?",

},
{
  "round": 2,
  "student": "I think it's 20 pages. That's my answer and I'm sticking to it.",

},
{
"round": 3,
  "student": "I don't care what 12 times 2 is. I said it's 20 pages, so it's 20 pages.",
